The folder contains separate header files -engine.h , matrix.h .degree_radian.h,quaternion.h.
The header files all the function definitons required for vector,matrix,quarternion calculations namely transformations of vectors and quarternions in linear algebra for computer graphics.
The source.cpp file is the main testing file for testing the individual headers for their functionality.
The class based system has been taken to omplement the headers and are securely locked with no memory leakage .The file is one the most important building block to make a game engine and is an essential engine component for vector transformations required for redndering the game graphics for game engine.
It will be updated with more finesse and is the primary skeletal structure of the math engine which is required for game engine development.
